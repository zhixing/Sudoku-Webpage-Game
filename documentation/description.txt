Your score is calculated according to how many cells you filled up and how many mistakes you made. The details is as follows:

Suppose you filled up n cells, of which m is wrong, then let k=n-m,

For the portion between 0  and 10, you gain 1 mark per cell.
For the portion between 10 and 25, you gain 2 mark per cell.
For the portion between 25 and 50, you gain 4 mark per cell.
For the portion between 50 and 60, you gain 8 mark for per cell.
For the portion between 60 and above, you gain 16 mark per cell.

Thus, for example, if you filled up 57 cells with 2 mistakes, k=n-m=55, hence the score is: 10*1 + 15*2 + 25*4 + 5*8 = 180.

Have fun there!







Summary:

This is my CVWO assignment final-submission. 

It's the first time that I build up a webpage. It's quite challenging for me at the beginning. I spent a few days going through the training session, learned about the skills I need. Then I started doing it. I encountered a great number of questions and bugs during the process, and I tried my best to come up with solutions by tracking codes, thinking and searching online. After all the headaches are gone, I gained a lot of programming skills in PHP and mySQL, and I learned a lot of cool stuff.

Here's a summary of the system:

1. Database shcema: 
	name: SudokuData, 
	table: Records, 
	columns: Series, Name, Email, Score, Quiz, Ans, Input.

2. How to play: Please refer to the user manual.

3. Remaining issues that might lead to unsecurity:

	3.1 I'm not familiar with the use of mysql_close(), it's usage may not be entirely correct.

	3.2 I didn't use SESSION variable. What I did was passing the name and password by submitting "form".

	3.3 There's no "log out" function. I asked the user to click "Home" or others to log out.
